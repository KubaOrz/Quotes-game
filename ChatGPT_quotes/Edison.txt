Thomas Edison
Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.
Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.
The three great essentials to achieve anything worthwhile are: hard work, stick-to-itiveness, and common sense.
Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time.
I never did a day's work in my life. It was all fun.
I find out what the world needs. Then, I proceed to invent it.
The value of an idea lies in the using of it.
There's a way to do it better - find it.
I never perfected an invention that I did not think about in terms of the service it might give others.
Opportunity is what happens when preparation meets luck.
Show me a thoroughly satisfied man, and I will show you a failure.
Success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.
Your worth consists in what you are and not in what you have.
Everything comes to him who hustles while he waits.
What you are will show in what you do.
The successful person makes a habit of doing what the failing person doesn't like to do.
Hell, there are no rules here - we're trying to accomplish something.
Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several thousand things that won't work.
